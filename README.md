# Arduino-code
Collection of my Arduino sketches used at work

Feel free to download them and use them as you wish

For the RCD code you may need to change the threshold value to suit your current meters if you find the circuit is tripping without a fault (increase threshold) or doesn't trip at all (decrease threshold)

For many of my arduino projects they use the CH340 Serial to USB chip so the drivers are here https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers/drivers-if-you-need-them
